Theorems we need to remember:

1. Theorems - Pythagorus Theorem
        expanation= in a right triangle a^2+b^2=c^2.( the twp legs squred will equal the hypotenuse squared)

2. Theorems - Converse of Pythagorus Theorem
        expanation= if the longest side of a trinagle squared is equal to the legs squred then the triangle is a right triangle
        
        DETERMINIGN WHETHER THE TRIANGLE IS RIGHT, ACUTE OR OBTUSE IF WE KNOW LEG/HYPOTENUSE LENGTHS
                a^2+b^2>c^2 --> the triangle is acute
                a^2+b^2=c^2 --> the triangle is right
                a^2+b^2<c^2 --> the triangle is obtuse

3. Theorems - 
        expanation
